1.What is the difference between getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll?
Answer:
getElementById returns a single element by its unique id, getElementsByClassName returns a collection of elements that share a specific class name, 
and querySelector/querySelectorAll return the first or all elements that match a CSS selector.
